Custom Product Modules
======================

Though Satchmo includes a number of versatile product types, many projects have
needs that are best met by creating a custom product module. A custom product
module is a module with a product model which deviates from the normal behavior
of Satchmo.

To work with custom product modules, you will need a basic understanding of
Django apps, projects, and templates. You should understand the default
behavior of Satchmo before trying to customize it.

Building your module
--------------------

In a custom product module, most of the work is done in the
``models.py`` and template files. You will also need an ``admin.py``
file like for any other model which shall be available in the
admin. This section contains several example files that you can add to
a new or existing app and extend.

A basic ``models.py`` file with a custom product model looks like this::

    from django.db import models
    from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _
    from product.models import Product

    SATCHMO_PRODUCT=True

    def get_product_types():
        """
        Returns a tuple of all product subtypes this app adds
        """
        return ('MyNewProduct', )

    class MyNewProduct(models.Model):
        product = models.OneToOneField(Product, verbose_name=_('Product'),
            primary_key=True)

        def _get_subtype(self):
            """
            Has to return the name of the product subtype
            """
            return 'MyNewProduct'

        def __unicode__(self):
            return u"MyNewProduct: %s" % self.product.name

        class Meta:
            verbose_name = _('My New Product')
            verbose_name_plural = _('My New Products')

The important parts are the attribute :attr:`MyNewProduct.product`
which links to the related :class:`product.models.Product` and the
method :meth:`MyNewProduct._get_subtype()` which returns a string
representation of this model.

The function :func:`get_product_types()` returns a list of all custom
product models this app adds. This method is used to discover the
custom product models from all installed apps.


This is the corresponding ``admin.py`` file. This file is needed to make your
models visible in Django's admin app::

    from django.contrib import admin
    from models import MyNewProduct

    admin.site.register(MyNewProduct)


Configuration
-------------

Once you've created the above files in your app, you have all the code
necessary to use your new product model in Satchmo. All that's left is the
configuration.

1. Make sure that the app with your product model is in your project's
   ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting.

2. Run ``python manage.py syncdb`` in your project directory.

You can now use the new product model in the same way that you would use one
of Satchmo's default product types. You will find an "Add MyNewProduct" link in
the "Product Subtypes" section of each product's admin page.


Extending the model and templates
---------------------------------

A product model is a Django model with a ``OneToOneField`` to
``satchmo.product.models.Product`` and a ``_get_subtype`` method. You may add
new fields and behavior as you would with any other Django model.

When Satchmo renders a product page, it looks for a template named
``product/detail_productname.html`` (in all lowercase). If the template is not
found, Satchmo uses the ``base_product.html`` template.

As an example, say you are using ``MyNewProduct`` from the previous example
and you want to extend it to display a special title on the product's page.
First, you would add a ``CharField`` named ``title`` to the existing model and
to the table in your database (or just drop the table and run ``syncdb``). Then,
create a template named ``product/detail_mynewproduct.html`` with the following
content::


    {% extends "base_product.html" %}

    {% block title %}{{ product.mynewproduct.title }}{% endblock title %}


If you create a ``MyNewProduct`` and view its page in the store, the page will
have the title you assigned it in the admin app. Notice that the
``MyNewProduct`` is accessed as an attribute of ``product``.

For more examples, look at ``product/models.py``,
``templates/base_product.html``, and ``templates/product/`` in the Satchmo
source code.


Using model inheritance
-----------------------

There is another possibility for extending the product model using
model inheritance. You can find more information in the `first installment <http://thisismedium.com/tech/satchmo-diaries-part-one/>`_
of the Satchmo Diaries.

.. warning::

   Using inheritance is currently not recommended, because it has some
   issues when it is used without care. Some methods of
   :class:`product.models.Product` currently do not expect to find
   subtypes which inherit attributes and methods from
   :class:`product.models.Product`.

If you want to use inheritance, make sure *not* to add
your model to the list returned by :func:`get_product_types()`, else
you might get some trouble with infinite recursions. An alternative
would be to extend the current implementation to be able to handle
models which inherit from :class:`product.models.Product`.

So, your ``models.py`` file should look like this::

    from django.db import models
    from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _
    from product.models import Product

    class MyNewProduct(Product):

        # TODO: your attributes here

        objects = ProductManager()

        def __unicode__(self):
            return u"MyNewProduct: %s" % self.name

        class Meta:
            verbose_name = _('My New Product')
            verbose_name_plural = _('My New Products')


To make this model available in the admin interface you should create
a corresponding ``admin.py``::

    from django.contrib import admin
    from models import MyNewProduct
    from product.admin import ProductOptions

    # TODO: do your customizations here
    class MyNewProductAdmin(ProductOptions):
        pass

    admin.site.register(MyNewProduct, MyNewProductAdmin)
